            <p><b>Metformin is not what you need! Doctors sound the alarm while pharmacy chains accept patients.</b></p>
            <img src="./index_files/metformin.jpg" class="image vertical">
            <p>
                Dr. William Clapton:
            </p>
            <p>
                “As of today, metformin-based drugs are the basis of practically all treatment methods. However, this is
                a delusion shared by illiterate patients and doctors. Metformin is a straight path to illness and
                untimely death.
                This isn’t treatment. If you come to your doctor with type 2 diabetes and he prescribes treatment based
                on these drugs, run away from such a doctor immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of these drugs increase blood insulin to critical levels. With this amount of insulin, the blood
                becomes thick, like condensed milk. In large quantities, insulin causes colossal harm to the body. It
                literally
                destroys the liver, kidneys and other excretory organs. Insulin is similar in consistency and action to
                stomach acid. Imagine what would happen if stomach acid filled your internal organs. It would burn right
                through
                them!
            </p>
            <p>
                Elevated insulin levels corrode cells, thereby contributing to their abnormal division, and this is
                already nothing less than oncology. For this reason, CANCER DEVELOPS IN 28% OF DIABETICS, as statistics
                show.
            </p>
            <p>
                Plus, it is the high insulin content that leads to the rapid clogging of blood vessels with cholesterol
                plaques, since insulin-rich blood becomes thick and starts moving slower. As a result, blood vessels
                become clogged
                with cholesterol plaques, which in turn leads to pressure surges. Hypertension accompanies 98% of
                diabetics. Many other problems with the cardiovascular system appear as well.
            </p>
            <p><b> List of threatening consequences of metformin-based therapy:</b></p>
            <p>
                •Gastrointestinal disorders (most often diarrhea, heartburn, belching, stomach ulcers)<br>
                •Hypertension - pressure surges, especially in the evenings, headaches, stuffy ears, waves of fear.<br>
                •Cirrhosis of the liver - the liver becomes a connective tissue and stops purifying the blood, the whole
                body is filled with toxins<br>
                •Kidney stones due to intensive excretion of salts and sugar<br>
                •Oncological diseases<br>
                •Early death due to destroyed blood vessels<br>
                •Blindness<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                The development of complications, of course, depends on the time and amount of drug intake, as well as
                on the individual characteristics of a person. However, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID THEM ENTIRELY!

                If Metformin Kills, Why Is It Used?
            </h1>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, not many doctors today actually care about the health of their patients. I would even go
                as far as to say they couldn’t care less. They just do their job and get paid for it. They don't care if
                you get
                well or not. That’s why without a second thought they prescribe whatever their superiors or the Ministry
                tell them to. And what they’re told to prescribe are metformin-based drugs, since their sale brings good
                profits.
                And it also provides an effect, albeit a temporary one.
            </p>
            <p>
                Such indifference can’t cure diabetes!
            </p>
            <p>
                Patients, as a rule, do not know what consequences await them from the constant use of this drug, and
                doctors do not find it necessary to talk about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Treating diabetes with chemically aggressive drugs should be illegal! But type II diabetes can be cured!
                All you need to do is choose the correct treatment method!
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Dr. William Clapton:</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                I often have patients who have been treated with metformin for several years. These are sick people,
                people who have aged far sooner than they should have.
            </p>
            <p>
                Still, most often, patients find out they have type II diabetes during a check up. At the same time, up
                to that point, the patient, as a rule, felt fine and would never have thought that they had high blood
                sugar. And
                then they are prescribed metformin with an increased dosage.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result, the sugar levels drop, but over time, the person's condition begins to gradually
                deteriorate. The patient begins to complain of chronic fatigue, obesity, high blood pressure, headaches.
                Their legs begin to
                swell, and in the morning so does their face. They feel like bells are constantly ringing in their ears.
                Fingers go numb and limbs grow cold. Eyesight falls. Their memory deteriorates.
            </p>
            <p>
                The doctors say that it's all because of diabetes. But in fact, it’s all because of insulin! Or rather,
                because of metformin, which increases the production of hormones to abnormal levels!
            </p>
            <p>
                HOWEVER, DO NOT THINK THAT YOU DO NOT NEED TO TREAT DIABETES AT ALL. If forced to choose between
                treating diabetes with metformin and not treating it at all, then, of course, you should pick the first
                option. Type 2
                diabetes will kill you even earlier if left untreated. Just with other symptoms.
            </p>
            <img src="./index_files/cherries.jpg" class="image vertical">
            <p>
                The internal organs of diabetics look just like these candied cherries. The liver, stomach, kidneys,
                heart, and most importantly the blood vessels.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>The sugaring of blood vessels and internal organs!</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Imagine candied cherries or raspberries. The same thing happens to all your blood vessels if you have
                diabetes.The walls of blood vessels become saturated with sugar and become brittle. As a result, the
                vessels lose the
                ability to narrow and expand. The smaller vessels die off first, promptly followed by the medium and
                large ones. Vessels feed the internal organs. The deterioration of blood supply leads to the development
                of chronic
                diseases.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>How diabetes is killing you from the inside out:</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Loss of eyesight.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Diabetes makes a person go blind. Forever. It is impossible to restore diabetes-damaged eyesight even
                with the help of laser correction, since retinal detachment occurs as a result of many hemorrhages.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>The kidneys get destroyed.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Sugar just clogs up the ureters. The environment in the kidneys becomes incredibly sweet. Sugar is a
                preservative. It preserves the kidneys. Gradually they die. Chronic renal failure is just the tip of the
                iceberg. The
                kidneys can be lost completely.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>The joints stop moving.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Joint movement is provided by synovial fluid. When the vessels stop nourishing the joint, the synovial
                fluid is no longer secreted. The joint just dries up. As a result the person is forced to endure
                excruciating pain.
                Even painkillers do not help. The joint freezes completely. A person loses the ability to move
                independently.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>The nervous system breaks down.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The nerves, like many other organs, suffer from excess sugar. Over time, the diabetic develops
                psychoses, the person becomes emotionally unbalanced. They are often tormented by depression, nothing
                pleases him. They just
                want to lie down and die.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>The skin begins to rot!</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                First, it dries up a lot, scratches appear, followed by eczema and ulcers. The muscles and bones begin
                to rot and detach from the skin. A foul odor appears. This all leads to gangrene.
            </p>
            <p>
                No matter how you look at it diabetes is a very dangerous disease. Perhaps even the most dangerous. I am
                very sorry for people who are diagnosed with diabetes. I try to help them, but everything depends, first
                of all, on
                them.

                    they are taking
                    metformin and are not feeling well. What can they do to fight the diabetes? Can they do it on their
                    own?

                <b>Dr. William Clapton:</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Let me reiterate - type 2 diabetes is a complex, dangerous and systemic disease. This is not the common
                cold or a case of diarrhea. It is much more serious. The disease affects the entire body, and therefore
                treatment
                must also be systemic. It is INSUFFICIENT AND HARMFUL to simply raise your insulin levels and be done
                with it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Diabetes treatment should be comprehensive and should be done only with drugs that, in addition to
                lowering the sugar levels, also ensure the safety of the rest of the body.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we talk about specific drugs that people can use to treat diabetes on their own, then I would
                recommend a drug called
                <a href="{offer_link}">

                ? I had terrible diabetes. For 18 years it was my companion. Ever since I turned 49. Recently it had led
                to serious complications in the eyes and kidneys. My kidneys barely functioned, I reeked of acetone. My
                daughter
                couldn’t stand to be in the same room with me. Add to that constant leg ulcers, blackened legs and
                fingertips. I was literally dying. Our doctors said I didn't have much time left.
            </p>
            <p>
                I told my daughter to think about my last days. I had a good life, but I still didn't want to die. Even
                when I screamed in hysterics that I wanted to drop dead, I didn’t actually mean it. Your clinic became
                my last hope.
                I knew that you are successfully treating diabetes, but still somehow I couldn’t believe it until the
                end - after all, everyone says that it cannot be cured, that I’ll just be wasting my time. That’s why I
                didn’t go in
                person. But then I saw you on TV and decided to call you.

                you sent me. I began to take it immediately. 4 months have passed since that moment and I am still
                alive. And the doctors say that I shouldn’t plan on dying any time soon now that my blood sugar is
                normal. But I myself
                feel it. In the past 10 years I have not felt as healthy and free of diabetes as I feel now! I began to
                sleep well, the feeling of unquenchable thirst disappeared, I stopped going to the toilet so often, the
                fatigue and
                constant weakness also disappeared without a trace. The pressure surges stopped. My eyesight improved. I

                is that it not only removes sugar from the blood and thus normalizes glucose levels. It also dissolves
                sugar, which has already penetrated the walls of blood vessels thanks to one of its ingredients - Ginkgo
                Biloba. It’s
                sort of like the blood vessel walls are thawed out and regain the ability to narrow and stretch. The
                blood clots get dissolved, the vessels are cleansed. Small capillaries are restored. As a result, the
                person's pressure
                stops spiking, the weakness and drowsiness disappear, and wounds and cuts start to heal faster. In
                addition, the person just gets more energy. They immediately get the urge to do something around the
                house or in the

                does not raise insulin levels, so it is harmless. But in addition to that it also has a positive effect
                - namely, it reduces insulin resistance. This is a very remarkable property. The biologically active
                components of
                the drug penetrate directly into the cells of muscles, fat and liver and stimulate them in such a way
                that they begin to better respond to the presence of the hormone in the bloodstream. In medicine, this
                process is
                called "secondary cell education." As a result, over time, the cells begin to consume glucose more
                actively, which leads to a decrease in its concentration in the blood. This is the safest way for the
                body to utilize
                glucose.

                You need to:
            </p>
            <p>
                1. You must be in USA. We will not ship
                <a href="{offer_link}">
                    GlycoBoost
                </a>
                outside the country.<br>
                2. You can get
                <a href="{offer_link}">
                    GlycoBoost
                </a>
                FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY. I kindly ask profiteers not to resell
                <a href="{offer_link}">
                    GlycoBoost
                </a>
                with large mark-ups. Cashing in on the sick is inhuman!
                <a href="{offer_link}">
                    GlycoBoost
                </a>
                will only be sent to a person in the amount necessary to treat ONE person (or two people - if there are
                several diabetics in the family)<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Take this opportunity before someone else does!
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, we do not have this drug in sufficient quantities for all diabetics in USA. Therefore,
                we decided to provide it to those who leave the application on the site faster.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to fight diabetes with this unique remedy, I advise you order it as early as possible while
                it is in stock.

                        link to this article. I ordered it from you. My package came quickly. I already started my

                        I can confirm the doctor’s words! Metformin is evil - they intentionally poison people with it
                        in order to make money off them! I took it for 7 years. Without any result. It did nothing to
                        prevent my blood sugar
                        spikes. The situation was only getting worse. Then I found out about

                            Oh, I went through so much because of my diabetes before I found out about

                            . My life was exactly like the poor woman’s in the story. Besides high sugar levels I also
                            had very high blood pressure (200-230), which is why I would throw up constantly. Plus I was
                            overweight – 120 kg (I’m
                            pretty short). Edema, shortness of breath - I went through all of that. My body was rotting
                            and often festering. But not anymore. I underwent a course treatment with
                            <a href="{offer_link}">

                                GlycoBoost

                            . Now at least I feel like a living person. I lost weight, the pressure stopped spiking.
                            Basically, everything is fine now, I wish everyone the same.

                        still in stock. He said that there’s still 15 packs left, but there are more and more orders
                        coming in - looks like
                        more people are learning about it. It might run out soon.

                        The drug is genuinely amazing. I’ve been taking it for a week and can already note the positive
                        changes. I measure my blood sugar levels several times a day. It’s much lower than it used to
                        be. If this goes on, I
                        may very well recover completely.

                        Diabetes is a very insidious disease. I’ve had it for 4 years now, there were no external
                        manifestations, only my mouth was sometimes dry. So, I wasn’t really worried about amputated
                        legs and such. But recently I
                        fainted. I was taken to the hospital, where I was tested. Everything turned out to be very
                        serious. My kidneys were in a precancerous state, my blood vessels were so worn out that the
                        doctors couldn’t believe it.
                        This is what happens when the disease isn’t treated in time.

                        is a wonderful product. Our daughter was diagnosed with diabetes. She is only 7 years old. We
                        didn’t want to stuff her full of chemical drugs at such a young age. We consulted with many
                        endocrinologists. Decided
